<h3>3. Description</h3>
<!--
Please give a brief description of your study, including some background, the purpose of the of the study, or broad research questions. 
Example: Though there is strong evidence to suggest that sugar affects taste preferences, the effect has never been demonstrated in brownies. Therefore, we will measure taste preference for four different levels of sugar concentration in a standard brownie recipe to determine if the effect exists in this pastry. 
More info: The description should be no longer than the length of an abstract. It can give some context for the proposed study, but great detail is not needed here for your preregistration. 
-->
<p>Scheduling theory is concerned with the development of policies which
determine the “optimal allocation of resources, over time, to a set of
tasks” (Parker, 1995). Scheduling problems have been studied extensively
in the context of operations research and computer science, where
optimal policies have been established for many cases. However, almost
no research has examined how cognitive and perceptual mechanisms perform
with respect to these optimal policies.</p>
<p>We know that switching between tasks leads to context shift costs
(Monsell, 2003) and that multitasking leads to inefficiencies and errors
(Strayer &amp; Johnston, 2001). But it is unclear whether people are
sensitive to the efficiency of different schedules and whether these
costs impact on the optimality of human scheduling. The current project
will develop a new framework for studying the scheduling of mental
processes in human cognition.</p>
<p>For many types of goals, such as minimizing the number of tasks
completed after a deadline or completing as many tasks as possible in a
given length of time, an optimal schedule can be determined (Chretienne
et al., 1995). In the present study, we are focused on the scheduling of
tasks that vary in difficulty where the goal is to complete as many
tasks as possible prior to the deadline. In this case, it is optimal to
complete subtasks in order of shortest to longest completion time.</p>
<p>Future experiments will additionally vary the utility/reward of each
subtask, the overall goal, and whether or not the difficulty needs to be
learned or is described.</p>
<p>In this study, each subtask is a typing task. Typewriting has become
an essential skill. Most people have the experience of typing on a
computer keyboard, especially most college students who have strong
typing skills have received formal training in typing (Logan &amp;
Crump, 2011). Typing is very complex in terms of its cognitive
processes. Logan and Crump (2011) proposed a two-loop theory to
demonstrate how hierarchical control is involved in skilled typing.
Firstly, an outer loop comprehends language, then generates words to be
typed, and finally passes them to the inner loop sequentially. The inner
loop translates words into several letters, then activates the
corresponding keystrokes, and lastly executes them in the correct order.
Since typewriting is controlled by these two hierarchical cognitive
mechanisms, a typing task can be well used to study scheduling in
higher-order human cognition as well as providing more real-world
implications.</p>
<p>In the typing task, a paragraph is presented, and participants must
type the paragraph accurately until completion. Any typing mistake is
not registered on the screen. Only correct keystrokes progress the typed
text. Multiple typing tasks will be presented on the selection screen.
Participants will click on the task they want to complete, type it to
complection, and then return to the main screen to select the next task.
The typing tasks will vary in length, and consequently, the average
completion time taken to type the text.</p>
<p>Typing length will be constant across trials but the text will be
randomly sampled from a book on border collies (Logan &amp; Crump,
2011). Typing tasks will be presented in onscreen at the four compass
points (North, South, East, West). Location of each difficulty level
will be either fixed across trials or random across trials. Once the
task is selected, the selection screen will be removed and the typing
task will be presented.</p>

<div id="hypotheses" class="section level3">
<h3>4. Hypotheses</h3>
<!-- 
List specific, concise, and testable hypotheses. Please state if the hypotheses are directional or non-directional. If directional, state the direction. A predicted effect is also appropriate here. If a specific interaction or moderation is important to your research, you can list that as a separate hypothesis. 
Example: If taste affects preference, then mean preference indices will be higher with higher concentrations of sugar. 
-->
<p>The optimal policy to minimize the number of tasks completed after
the deadline (or i.e., to maximize the number of tasks completed before
the deadline) is to complete shortest subtask first. We will determine
whether participants converge to this optimal schedule. We will compare
scheduling both with and without a deadline and expect greater
optimality when participants have to complete the typing task under a
deadline. We additionally expect greater optimality when difficulty
location is held constant compared to when it is varied from trial to
trial.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="design-plan" class="section level2">
<h2>Design Plan</h2>
<!-- 
In this section, you will be asked to describe the overall design of your study. Remember that this research plan is designed to register a single study, so if you have multiple experimental designs, please complete a separate preregistration. 
-->
<p>In this experiment, participants will complete multiple trials for
selecting and completing typing tasks. On each trial, participants will
be shown a set of four tasks labelled Short, Medium, Long, and Very Long
The labels correspond to the length of the typing task. Participants
will select and complete one task at a time, in any order, completing as
many as possible before a deadline.</p>
<p>Before completing the deadline task, participants will complete a
short number of trials with no deadline (e.g., 2). This will help
participants learn the task, explore strategies, and allow us to compare

<h3>8. Study design</h3>
<!-- 
Describe your study design. Examples include two-group, factorial, randomized block, and repeated measures. Is it a between (unpaired), within-subject (paired), or mixed design? Describe any counterbalancing required. Typical study designs for observation studies include cohort, cross sectional, and case-control studies.
Example: We have a between subjects design with 1 factor (sugar by mass) with 4 levels. 
More info: This question has a variety of possible answers. The key is for a researcher to be as detailed as is necessary given the specifics of their design. Be careful to determine if every parameter has been specified in the description of the study design. There may be some overlap between this question and the following questions. That is OK, as long as sufficient detail is given in one of the areas to provide all of the requested information. For example, if the study design describes a complete factorial, 2 X 3 design and the treatments and levels are specified previously, you do not have to repeat that information. 
-->
<p>Difficulty location will be randomized across subjects. Four length
levels will be used to manipulate the completion time. Long tasks will
be half as long as very long tasks, medium tasks are half as long as
long tasks, and short tasks are half as long as medium tasks. A single
deadline of e.g., 90 seconds will be tested and compared to a no
deadline condition (i.e., a long trial length of 240 seconds). In
Experiment 2, the deadline will be based on typing performance.</p>

<h3>9. Randomization</h3>
<!-- 
If you are doing a randomized study, how will you randomize, and at what level?
Example: We will use block randomization, where each participant will be randomly assigned to one of the four equally sized, predetermined blocks. The random number list used to create these four blocks will be created using the web applications available at http://random.org. 
More info: Typical randomization techniques include: simple, block, stratified, and adaptive covariate randomization. If randomization is required for the study, the method should be specified here, not simply the source of random numbers.

<li>Registration prior to any human observation of the data: As of the
date of submission, the data exist but have not yet been quantified,
constructed, observed, or reported by anyone - including individuals
that are not associated with the proposed study. Examples include museum
specimens that have not been measured and data that have been collected
by non-human collectors and are inaccessible. <!--
- Registration prior to accessing the data: As of the date of submission, the data exist, but have not been accessed by you or your collaborators. Commonly, this includes data that has been collected by another researcher or institution.

- Registration prior to analysis of the data: As of the date of submission, the data exist and you have accessed it, though no analysis has been conducted related to the research plan (including calculation of summary statistics). A common situation for this scenario when a large dataset exists that is used for many different studies over time, or when a data set is randomly split into a sample for exploratory analyses, and the other section of data is reserved for later confirmatory data analysis.

This may include an explanation of how access to the data has been limited, who has observed the data, or how you have avoided observing any analysis of the specific data you will use in your study. 
Example: An appropriate instance of using existing data would be collecting a sample size much larger than is required for the study, using a small portion of it to conduct exploratory analysis, and then registering one particular analysis that showed promising results. After registration, conduct the specified analysis on that part of the dataset that had not been investigated by the researcher up to that point.

<div id="data-collection-procedures" class="section level3">
<h3>12. Data collection procedures</h3>
<!-- 
Please describe the process by which you will collect your data. If you are using human subjects, this should include the population from which you obtain subjects, recruitment efforts, payment for participation, how subjects will be selected for eligibility from the initial pool (e.g. inclusion and exclusion rules), and your study timeline. For studies that donÍt include human subjects, include information about how you will collect samples, duration of data gathering efforts, source or location of samples, or batch numbers you will use. 
Example: Participants will be recruited through advertisements at local pastry shops. Participants will be paid $10 for agreeing to participate (raised to $30 if our sample size is not reached within 15 days of beginning recruitment). Participants must be at least 18 years old and be able to eat the ingredients of the pastries.
More information: The answer to this question requires a specific set of instructions so that another person could repeat the data collection procedures and recreate the study population. Alternatively, if the study population would be unable to be reproduced because it relies on a specific set of circumstances unlikely to be recreated (e.g., a community of people from a specific time and location), the criteria and methods for creating the group and the rationale for this unique set of subjects should be clear.

the University of Newcastle’s Research Experience Program. Participants
will be reimbursed 1 credit for participation.</p>

<div id="sample-size" class="section level3">
<h3>13. Sample size</h3>
<!-- 
Describe the sample size of your study. How many units will be analyzed in the study? This could be the number of people, birds, classrooms, plots, interactions, or countries included. If the units are not individuals, then describe the size requirements for each unit. If you are using a clustered or multilevel design, how many units are you collecting at each level of the analysis?
Example: Our target sample size is 280 participants. We will attempt to recruit up to 320, assuming that not all will complete the total task. 
More information: For some studies, this will simply be the number of samples or the number of clusters. For others, this could be an expected range, minimum, or maximum number. 
-->
<p>We will recruit 100 participants in the fixed and random location
conditions (N = 100 total).</p>
<p>In each condition, participants will complete two no deadline
scheduling trials and two deadline scheduling trials via a web
browser.</p>
</div>
<div id="sample-size-rationale" class="section level3">
<h3>14. Sample size rationale</h3>
<!-- 
This could include a power analysis or an arbitrary constraint such as time, money, or personnel.
Example: We used the software program G*Power to conduct a power analysis. Our goal was to obtain .95 power to detect a medium effect size of .25 at the standard .05 alpha error probability. 
More information: This gives you an opportunity to specifically state how the sample size will be determined. A wide range of possible answers is acceptable; remember that transparency is more important than principled justifications. If you state any reason for a sample size upfront, it is better than stating no reason and leaving the reader to “fill in the blanks.” Acceptable rationales include: a power analysis, an arbitrary number of subjects, or a number based on time or monetary constraints. 
-->
<p>This is a preliminary study. Sample size is chosen based on pragmatic
considerations.</p>
</div>
<div id="stopping-rule" class="section level3">
<h3>15. Stopping rule</h3>
<!-- 
If your data collection procedures do not give you full control over your exact sample size, specify how you will decide when to terminate your data collection. 
Example: We will post participant sign-up slots by week on the preceding Friday night, with 20 spots posted per week. We will post 20 new slots each week if, on that Friday night, we are below 320 participants. 
More information: You may specify a stopping rule based on p-values only in the specific case of sequential analyses with pre-specified checkpoints, alphas levels, and stopping rules. Unacceptable rationales include stopping based on p-values if checkpoints and stopping rules are not specified. If you have control over your sample size, then including a stopping rule is not necessary, though it must be clear in this question or a previous question how an exact sample size is attained. 
-->
<p>Sampling will be stopped after 100 participants have been collected
or as close as possible given asynchronicity between remote enrolment in
the experiment and completion of the experiment. .</p>

<h2>Variables</h2>
<!-- 
In this section you can describe all variables (both manipulated and measured variables) that will later be used in your confirmatory analysis plan. In your analysis plan, you will have the opportunity to describe how each variable will be used. If you have variables which you are measuring for exploratory analyses, you are not required to list them, though you are permitted to do so. 
-->
<div id="manipulated-variables" class="section level3">
<h3>16. Manipulated variables</h3>
<!-- 
Describe all variables you plan to manipulate and the levels or treatment arms of each variable. This is not applicable to any observational study. 
Example: We manipulated the percentage of sugar by mass added to brownies. The four levels of this categorical variable are: 15%, 20%, 25%, or 40% cane sugar by mass. 
More information: For any experimental manipulation, you should give a precise definition of each manipulated variable. This must include a precise description of the levels at which each variable will be set, or a specific definition for each categorical treatment. For example, “loud or quiet,” should instead give either a precise decibel level or a means of recreating each level. 'Presence/absence' or 'positive/negative' is an acceptable description if the variable is precisely described.
-->
<p>We will manipulate the length of the typing task and the deadline
available for selection and completion of the four tasks on each trial.
We will additionally manipulate whether there was a deadline or not.</p>
</div>
<div id="measured-variables" class="section level3">
<h3>17. Measured variables</h3>
<!-- 
Describe each variable that you will measure. This will include outcome measures, as well as any predictors or covariates that you will measure. You do not need to include any variables that you plan on collecting if they are not going to be included in the confirmatory analyses of this study.
Example: The single outcome variable will be the perceived tastiness of the single brownie each participant will eat. We will measure this by asking participants ‘How much did you enjoy eating the brownie’ (on a scale of 1-7, 1 being ‘not at all’, 7 being ‘a great deal’) and ‘How good did the brownie taste’ (on a scale of 1-7, 1 being ‘very bad’, 7 being ‘very good’). 
More information: Observational studies and meta-analyses will include only measured variables. As with the previous questions, the answers here must be precise. For example, 'intelligence,' 'accuracy,' 'aggression,' and 'color' are too vague. Acceptable alternatives could be 'IQ as measured by Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale' 'percent correct,' 'number of threat displays,' and 'percent reflectance at 400 nm.'
-->
<p>The main variable is the order in which subtasks are completed.
Secondary variables are the accuracy and completion time of the
subtasks.</p>
</div>
<div id="indices" class="section level3">
<h3>18. Indices</h3>
<!-- 
If any measurements are  going to be combined into an index (or even a mean), what measures will you use and how will they be combined? Include either a formula or a precise description of your method. If your are using a more complicated statistical method to combine measures (e.g. a factor analysis), you can note that here but describe the exact method in the analysis plan section.
Example: We will take the mean of the two questions above to create a single measure of ‘brownie enjoyment.’ 
More information: If you are using multiple pieces of data to construct a single variable, how will this occur? Both the data that are included and the formula or weights for each measure must be specified. Standard summary statistics, such as “means” do not require a formula, though more complicated indices require either the exact formula or, if it is an established index in the field, the index must be unambiguously defined. For example, “biodiversity index” is too broad, whereas “Shannon’s biodiversity index” is appropriate.

<h2>Analysis Plan</h2>
<!-- 
You may describe one or more confirmatory analysis in this preregistration. Please remember that all analyses specified below must be reported in the final article, and any additional analyses must be noted as exploratory or hypothesis generating.
A confirmatory analysis plan must state up front which variables are predictors (independent) and which are the outcomes (dependent), otherwise it is an exploratory analysis. You are allowed to describe any exploratory work here, but a clear confirmatory analysis is required. 
-->
<div id="statistical-models" class="section level3">
<h3>19. Statistical models</h3>
<!-- 
What statistical model will you use to test each hypothesis? Please include the type of model (e.g. ANOVA, multiple regression, SEM, etc) and the specification of the model (this includes each variable that will be included as predictors, outcomes, or covariates). Please specify any interactions, subgroup analyses, pairwise or complex contrasts, or follow-up tests from omnibus tests. If you plan on using any positive controls, negative controls, or manipulation checks you may mention that here. Remember that any test not included here must be noted as an exploratory test in your final article. 
Example:  We will use a one-way between subjects ANOVA to analyze our results. The manipulated, categorical independent variable is 'sugar' whereas the dependent variable is our taste index. 
More information: This is perhaps the most important and most complicated question within the preregistration. As with all of the other questions, the key is to provide a specific recipe for analyzing the collected data. Ask yourself: is enough detail provided to run the same analysis again with the information provided by the user? Be aware for instances where the statistical models appear specific, but actually leave openings for the precise test. See the following examples: 
If someone specifies a 2x3 ANOVA with both factors within subjects, there is still flexibility with the various types of ANOVAs that could be run. Either a repeated measures ANOVA (RMANOVA) or a multivariate ANOVA (MANOVA) could be used for that design, which are two different tests. 
If you are going to perform a sequential analysis and check after 50, 100, and 150 samples, you must also specify the p-values you’ll test against at those three points.
-->
<p>For each participant, the optimal order of each location will be
determined (i.e., from easiest to hardest). The first analysis will
compute something like Kendall’s Tau, rank-order distance. What we want
is the distance of the selected options from the optimal solutions,
which is Kendall’s Tau. However, because a participant may run out of
time, there may be missing values. To handle these values, for each
trial, we find the orders which partially match the selected order and
compute: (1) the maximum distance of those possible orders and the
optimal solution and (2) the average distance of those possible orders
and the optimal solution.</p>
<p>We will examine the distribution of distances across participants to
determine how much they deviate from optimal. Bayesian analysis will be
used to characterise the posterior uncertainty in distance across
trials.</p>
<p>We will perform a similar analysis using the proportion of
first-optimal responses (i.e., the proportion of responses in which the
first chosen option is the easiest).</p>
<p>We will additionally create “spatial-order” strategies (e.g.,
clockwise strategy, anti-clockwise strategy) and compute the
partial-matching Kendall’s Tau measure of the response to these spatial
orders. These strategies may be non-optimal, depending on the random
distribution of difficulties; nonetheless, participants may adopt these
strategies.</p>
<p>We will compare the optimality of the untimed trials against the
deadline trials using a Bayesian one-way ANOVA and a hierarchical
Bayesian model described below.</p>
</div>
<div id="transformations" class="section level3">
<h3>20. Transformations</h3>
<!-- 
If you plan on transforming, centering, recoding the data, or will require a coding scheme for categorical variables, please describe that process.
Example: The “Effect of sugar on brownie tastiness” does not require any additional transformations. However, if it were using a regression analysis and each level of sweet had been categorically described (e.g. not sweet, somewhat sweet, sweet, and very sweet), ‘sweet’ could be dummy coded with ‘not sweet’ as the reference category. 
More information: If any categorical predictors are included in a regression, indicate how those variables will be coded (e.g. dummy coding, summation coding, etc.) and what the reference category will be. 
-->
<p>N/A</p>
</div>
<div id="inference-criteria" class="section level3">
<h3>21. Inference criteria</h3>
<!-- 
What criteria will you use to make inferences? Please describe the information youÍll use (e.g. p-values, bayes factors, specific model fit indices), as well as cut-off criterion, where appropriate. Will you be using one or two tailed tests for each of your analyses? If you are comparing multiple conditions or testing multiple hypotheses, will you account for this?
Example: We will use the standard p<.05 criteria for determining if the ANOVA and the post hoc test suggest that the results are significantly different from those expected if the null hypothesis were correct. The post-hoc Tukey-Kramer test adjusts for multiple comparisons. 
More information: P-values, confidence intervals, and effect sizes are standard means for making an inference, and any level is acceptable, though some criteria must be specified in this or previous fields. Bayesian analyses should specify a Bayes factor or a credible interval. If you are selecting models, then how will you determine the relative quality of each? In regards to multiple comparisons, this is a question with few “wrong” answers. In other words, transparency is more important than any specific method of controlling the false discovery rate or false error rate. One may state an intention to report all tests conducted or one may conduct a specific correction procedure; either strategy is acceptable.
-->
<p>Posterior parameter estimation will be used for inference. Optimality
(measured using normalised Kendall’s Tau adjusted for missing data as
described above) will be given a uniform Beta(1,1) prior in each
condition. We will compare two models, one in which the hyperpriors are
free to vary across the untimed and deadline conditions, and one in
which the hyperpriors are fixed. Posterior parameter estimation and DIC
will be used to examine whether there is a credible difference in
optimality between deadline conditions.</p>
</div>
<div id="data-exclusion" class="section level3">
<h3>22. Data exclusion</h3>
<!-- 
How will you determine what data or samples, if any, to exclude from your analyses? How will outliers be handled? Will you use any awareness check?
Example: No checks will be performed to determine eligibility for inclusion besides verification that each subject answered each of the three tastiness indices. Outliers will be included in the analysis. 
More information: Any rule for excluding a particular set of data is acceptable. One may describe rules for excluding a participant or for identifying outlier data.
-->
<p>Initial analysis will not exclude any data. Followup analyses may
exclude data on the basis of typing task performance.</p>
</div>
<div id="missing-data" class="section level3">
<h3>23. Missing data</h3>
<!-- 
How will you deal with incomplete or missing data?
Example: If a subject does not complete any of the three indices of tastiness, that subject will not be included in the analysis.
More information: Any relevant explanation is acceptable. As a final reminder, remember that the final analysis must follow the specified plan, and deviations must be either strongly justified or included as a separate, exploratory analysis. 
-->
<p>Participants will be excluded if they do not complete all trials.</p>
</div>
<div id="exploratory-analysis" class="section level3">
<h3>24. Exploratory analysis</h3>
<!-- 
If you plan to explore your data set to look for unexpected differences or relationships, you may describe those tests here. An exploratory test is any test where a prediction is not made up front, or there are multiple possible tests that you are going to use. A statistically significant finding in an exploratory test is a great way to form a new confirmatory hypothesis, which could be registered at a later time. 
Example: We expect that certain demographic traits may be related to taste preferences. Therefore, we will look for relationships between demographic variables (age, gender, income, and marital status) and the primary outcome measures of taste preferences.
-->
<p>Most of the data analyses considered so far may be considered
exploratory in that we make no particular hypothesis as to whether
scheduling should be optimal or not.</p>
