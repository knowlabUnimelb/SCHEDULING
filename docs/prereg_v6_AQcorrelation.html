The results in this page were generated with repository version

See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made
to the R Markdown and HTML files.

<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for
the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results
(you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or
<code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown
file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it
depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results
were generated:

<h3>3. Description</h3>
<!--
Please give a brief description of your study, including some background, the purpose of the of the study, or broad research questions. 
Example: Though there is strong evidence to suggest that sugar affects taste preferences, the effect has never been demonstrated in brownies. Therefore, we will measure taste preference for four different levels of sugar concentration in a standard brownie recipe to determine if the effect exists in this pastry. 
More info: The description should be no longer than the length of an abstract. It can give some context for the proposed study, but great detail is not needed here for your preregistration. 
-->
<p>In a prior pre-registered study (<a href="https://osf.io/p2e9y"
class="uri">https://osf.io/p2e9y</a>), we conducted an exploratory
analysis of the relationship between scheduling optimality and Autism
Spectrum Disorder as measured by the Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ;
Baron-Cohen et al., 2001). Surprisingly, we found a significant positive
correlation between the distance from the optimal schedule and the AQ
score in a sample of N = 70; r = .37, p = .0013.</p>
<p>The purpose of this document is to pre-register a larger replication
effort in attempt to validate that result. The primary task will follow
our previous studies (<a
href="https://knowlabunimelb.github.io/SCHEDULING/index.html"
class="uri">https://knowlabunimelb.github.io/SCHEDULING/index.html</a>),
which used a procedure in which participants were presented with four
Random Dot Motion tasks of varying difficulty (labelled on screen).
Participants select the task they want to complete and then they
complete that task before returning to the selection. Participants
complete a number of trials under both a long and short deadline (10 and
30 trials, respectively) which are used to derive an average distance
score. This score counts the number of swaps between the optimal
schedule and a participant’s selected schedule on each trial and then
averages the results across trials. With four tasks this score ranges
from 0 (optimal) to 6 (non-optimal).</p>
<p>Under instructions to complete as many tasks as possible before the
deadline, the optimal scheduling policy is to complete the tasks from
easiest to hardest. After completion o 1 practice trial, 10 long
deadline, and 30 short deadline trials (in that order), participants
will complete the AQ survey.</p>

<h3>4. Hypotheses</h3>
<!-- 
List specific, concise, and testable hypotheses. Please state if the hypotheses are directional or non-directional. If directional, state the direction. A predicted effect is also appropriate here. If a specific interaction or moderation is important to your research, you can list that as a separate hypothesis. 
Example: If taste affects preference, then mean preference indices will be higher with higher concentrations of sugar. 
-->
<p>If the relation between scheduling and AQ score is real (i.e.,
reflects something other than noise), then we expect to find a
significant positive correlation between those variables.</p>

<h2>Design Plan</h2>
<!-- 
In this section, you will be asked to describe the overall design of your study. Remember that this research plan is designed to register a single study, so if you have multiple experimental designs, please complete a separate preregistration. 
-->
<p>In this experiment, participants will complete multiple trials for
selecting and completing typing tasks. On each trial, participants will
be shown a set of four tasks labelled Easy, Medium, Hard, and Very Hard.
The labels correspond to the coherence of the RDK.</p>
<p>Before completing the deadline task, participants will complete a
trial with no deadline. This will help participants learn the task and
explore strategies. Participants will then complete 10 trials with a
long deadline followed by 30 trials with a short deadline.</p>

<h3>8. Study design</h3>
<!-- 
Describe your study design. Examples include two-group, factorial, randomized block, and repeated measures. Is it a between (unpaired), within-subject (paired), or mixed design? Describe any counterbalancing required. Typical study designs for observation studies include cohort, cross sectional, and case-control studies.
Example: We have a between subjects design with 1 factor (sugar by mass) with 4 levels. 
More info: This question has a variety of possible answers. The key is for a researcher to be as detailed as is necessary given the specifics of their design. Be careful to determine if every parameter has been specified in the description of the study design. There may be some overlap between this question and the following questions. That is OK, as long as sufficient detail is given in one of the areas to provide all of the requested information. For example, if the study design describes a complete factorial, 2 X 3 design and the treatments and levels are specified previously, you do not have to repeat that information.

<p>Difficulty location will be randomized across subjects. Four
coherence levels will be used to manipulate difficulty (proportions of
0.8, 0.5, 0.1, and 0.01). The short deadline will be 6 seconds; this has
previously been shown to be sufficient to allow an average of 75% of the

Please describe the process by which you will collect your data. If you are using human subjects, this should include the population from which you obtain subjects, recruitment efforts, payment for participation, how subjects will be selected for eligibility from the initial pool (e.g. inclusion and exclusion rules), and your study timeline. For studies that donÍt include human subjects, include information about how you will collect samples, duration of data gathering efforts, source or location of samples, or batch numbers you will use. 
Example: Participants will be recruited through advertisements at local pastry shops. Participants will be paid $10 for agreeing to participate (raised to $30 if our sample size is not reached within 15 days of beginning recruitment). Participants must be at least 18 years old and be able to eat the ingredients of the pastries.
More information: The answer to this question requires a specific set of instructions so that another person could repeat the data collection procedures and recreate the study population. Alternatively, if the study population would be unable to be reproduced because it relies on a specific set of circumstances unlikely to be recreated (e.g., a community of people from a specific time and location), the criteria and methods for creating the group and the rationale for this unique set of subjects should be clear.

<h3>13. Sample size</h3>
<!-- 
Describe the sample size of your study. How many units will be analyzed in the study? This could be the number of people, birds, classrooms, plots, interactions, or countries included. If the units are not individuals, then describe the size requirements for each unit. If you are using a clustered or multilevel design, how many units are you collecting at each level of the analysis?
Example: Our target sample size is 280 participants. We will attempt to recruit up to 320, assuming that not all will complete the total task. 
More information: For some studies, this will simply be the number of samples or the number of clusters. For others, this could be an expected range, minimum, or maximum number. 
-->
<p>Due to a shortage of studies in the Research Experience Program, we
are permitted to test an unbounded number of participants between now
and 10 Nov 2023. The study will run in this period with an aim of
collecting as many participants as possible in this time.</p>
</div>
<div id="sample-size-rationale" class="section level3">
<h3>14. Sample size rationale</h3>
<!-- 
This could include a power analysis or an arbitrary constraint such as time, money, or personnel.
Example: We used the software program G*Power to conduct a power analysis. Our goal was to obtain .95 power to detect a medium effect size of .25 at the standard .05 alpha error probability. 
More information: This gives you an opportunity to specifically state how the sample size will be determined. A wide range of possible answers is acceptable; remember that transparency is more important than principled justifications. If you state any reason for a sample size upfront, it is better than stating no reason and leaving the reader to “fill in the blanks.” Acceptable rationales include: a power analysis, an arbitrary number of subjects, or a number based on time or monetary constraints. 
-->
<p>According to the calculator here: <a
href="http://sample-size.net/correlation-sample-size/"
class="uri">http://sample-size.net/correlation-sample-size/</a>, to
achieve at 80% power given an expected population rho of 0.38, the
minimum sample size is 52 participants. The 95% CI’s on our pilot
correlation are 0.15 to 0.56. If we assume the lower value, then
according , we would need approximately 347 participants to detect this
correlation with 80% power. In the sampling period, we aim to sample at
least 350 participants.</p>

<div id="stopping-rule" class="section level3">
<h3>15. Stopping rule</h3>
<!-- 
If your data collection procedures do not give you full control over your exact sample size, specify how you will decide when to terminate your data collection. 
Example: We will post participant sign-up slots by week on the preceding Friday night, with 20 spots posted per week. We will post 20 new slots each week if, on that Friday night, we are below 320 participants. 
More information: You may specify a stopping rule based on p-values only in the specific case of sequential analyses with pre-specified checkpoints, alphas levels, and stopping rules. Unacceptable rationales include stopping based on p-values if checkpoints and stopping rules are not specified. If you have control over your sample size, then including a stopping rule is not necessary, though it must be clear in this question or a previous question how an exact sample size is attained.

<div id="manipulated-variables" class="section level3">
<h3>16. Manipulated variables</h3>
<!-- 
Describe all variables you plan to manipulate and the levels or treatment arms of each variable. This is not applicable to any observational study. 
Example: We manipulated the percentage of sugar by mass added to brownies. The four levels of this categorical variable are: 15%, 20%, 25%, or 40% cane sugar by mass. 
More information: For any experimental manipulation, you should give a precise definition of each manipulated variable. This must include a precise description of the levels at which each variable will be set, or a specific definition for each categorical treatment. For example, “loud or quiet,” should instead give either a precise decibel level or a means of recreating each level. 'Presence/absence' or 'positive/negative' is an acceptable description if the variable is precisely described.
-->
<p>We will manipulate the coherence and direction of four RDK tasks and
the deadline available for selection and completion of the four tasks on
each trial.</p>
</div>
<div id="measured-variables" class="section level3">
<h3>17. Measured variables</h3>
<!-- 
Describe each variable that you will measure. This will include outcome measures, as well as any predictors or covariates that you will measure. You do not need to include any variables that you plan on collecting if they are not going to be included in the confirmatory analyses of this study.
Example: The single outcome variable will be the perceived tastiness of the single brownie each participant will eat. We will measure this by asking participants ‘How much did you enjoy eating the brownie’ (on a scale of 1-7, 1 being ‘not at all’, 7 being ‘a great deal’) and ‘How good did the brownie taste’ (on a scale of 1-7, 1 being ‘very bad’, 7 being ‘very good’). 
More information: Observational studies and meta-analyses will include only measured variables. As with the previous questions, the answers here must be precise. For example, 'intelligence,' 'accuracy,' 'aggression,' and 'color' are too vague. Acceptable alternatives could be 'IQ as measured by Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale' 'percent correct,' 'number of threat displays,' and 'percent reflectance at 400 nm.'
-->
<p>The main variable is the order in which subtasks are completed.
Secondary variables are the accuracy and completion time of the
subtasks.</p>
</div>
<div id="indices" class="section level3">
<h3>18. Indices</h3>
<!-- 
If any measurements are  going to be combined into an index (or even a mean), what measures will you use and how will they be combined? Include either a formula or a precise description of your method. If your are using a more complicated statistical method to combine measures (e.g. a factor analysis), you can note that here but describe the exact method in the analysis plan section.
Example: We will take the mean of the two questions above to create a single measure of ‘brownie enjoyment.’ 
More information: If you are using multiple pieces of data to construct a single variable, how will this occur? Both the data that are included and the formula or weights for each measure must be specified. Standard summary statistics, such as “means” do not require a formula, though more complicated indices require either the exact formula or, if it is an established index in the field, the index must be unambiguously defined. For example, “biodiversity index” is too broad, whereas “Shannon’s biodiversity index” is appropriate.

<h2>Analysis Plan</h2>
<!-- 
You may describe one or more confirmatory analysis in this preregistration. Please remember that all analyses specified below must be reported in the final article, and any additional analyses must be noted as exploratory or hypothesis generating.
A confirmatory analysis plan must state up front which variables are predictors (independent) and which are the outcomes (dependent), otherwise it is an exploratory analysis. You are allowed to describe any exploratory work here, but a clear confirmatory analysis is required. 
-->
<div id="statistical-models" class="section level3">
<h3>19. Statistical models</h3>
<!-- 
What statistical model will you use to test each hypothesis? Please include the type of model (e.g. ANOVA, multiple regression, SEM, etc) and the specification of the model (this includes each variable that will be included as predictors, outcomes, or covariates). Please specify any interactions, subgroup analyses, pairwise or complex contrasts, or follow-up tests from omnibus tests. If you plan on using any positive controls, negative controls, or manipulation checks you may mention that here. Remember that any test not included here must be noted as an exploratory test in your final article. 
Example:  We will use a one-way between subjects ANOVA to analyze our results. The manipulated, categorical independent variable is 'sugar' whereas the dependent variable is our taste index. 
More information: This is perhaps the most important and most complicated question within the preregistration. As with all of the other questions, the key is to provide a specific recipe for analyzing the collected data. Ask yourself: is enough detail provided to run the same analysis again with the information provided by the user? Be aware for instances where the statistical models appear specific, but actually leave openings for the precise test. See the following examples: 
If someone specifies a 2x3 ANOVA with both factors within subjects, there is still flexibility with the various types of ANOVAs that could be run. Either a repeated measures ANOVA (RMANOVA) or a multivariate ANOVA (MANOVA) could be used for that design, which are two different tests. 
If you are going to perform a sequential analysis and check after 50, 100, and 150 samples, you must also specify the p-values you’ll test against at those three points.
-->
<p>We will first conduct a number of manipulation checks in order to
determine: a) if the deadline was effective and b) if the coherence
manipulation was effective. We will compare the number of tasks
completed between the long and short deadline phases using a t-test. we
will compare the accuracy and response time across each level of
coherence in the short and long deadline phases using a 4 Difficulty x 2
Deadline ANOVA. Linear contrast analyses will also be conducted.</p>
<p>For each participant, the optimal order of each location will be
determined (i.e., from easiest to hardest). We will compute the marginal
response orders for each tasks (i.e., the probability of selection the
easy, medium, hard, and very hard subtasks in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th
positions). Marginal response probabilities will be compared to uniform
responding using a chi^2 test. We also use chi^2 tests of independence
to compare each condition’s marginal response probabilities to each
other.</p>
<p>The marginal response analyses provide information about the order in
each subtask was selected; however, the marginal distributions do not
reveal anything about whether there were sequences of selections (e.g.,
was the medium task chosen after the easy task?) or how optimal those
sequences were. To assess this, we examined the distance of each
selected sequence from the optimal order (i.e., easy to very hard). To
account for incomplete selections (due to timeouts), we will compute the
distance between all of the hypothetical sequences that could have
resulted and then averaged the distances across these sequences.
Distance was computed as the number of swaps necessary to transform the
selected sequence to the optimal sequence and varied from 0 (optimal) to
6.</p>
<p>We will examine the distribution of distances across participants to
determine how much they deviate from optimal. Distributions will be
compared between conditions using ks-tests.</p>
<p>The average distance will be correlated with the AQ score as
described above.</p>
</div>
<div id="transformations" class="section level3">
<h3>20. Transformations</h3>
<!-- 
If you plan on transforming, centering, recoding the data, or will require a coding scheme for categorical variables, please describe that process.
Example: The “Effect of sugar on brownie tastiness” does not require any additional transformations. However, if it were using a regression analysis and each level of sweet had been categorically described (e.g. not sweet, somewhat sweet, sweet, and very sweet), ‘sweet’ could be dummy coded with ‘not sweet’ as the reference category. 
More information: If any categorical predictors are included in a regression, indicate how those variables will be coded (e.g. dummy coding, summation coding, etc.) and what the reference category will be. 
-->
<p>If an error is made when completing an RDK, the experiment will pause
for a 500 msec time penalty, the direction will be randomly resampled,
and participants will have to complete that RDK again. Response time to
complete an RDK will be computed as the total cumulative time until a
correct response is made.</p>
</div>
<div id="inference-criteria" class="section level3">
<h3>21. Inference criteria</h3>
<!-- 
What criteria will you use to make inferences? Please describe the information youÍll use (e.g. p-values, bayes factors, specific model fit indices), as well as cut-off criterion, where appropriate. Will you be using one or two tailed tests for each of your analyses? If you are comparing multiple conditions or testing multiple hypotheses, will you account for this?
Example: We will use the standard p<.05 criteria for determining if the ANOVA and the post hoc test suggest that the results are significantly different from those expected if the null hypothesis were correct. The post-hoc Tukey-Kramer test adjusts for multiple comparisons. 
More information: P-values, confidence intervals, and effect sizes are standard means for making an inference, and any level is acceptable, though some criteria must be specified in this or previous fields. Bayesian analyses should specify a Bayes factor or a credible interval. If you are selecting models, then how will you determine the relative quality of each? In regards to multiple comparisons, this is a question with few “wrong” answers. In other words, transparency is more important than any specific method of controlling the false discovery rate or false error rate. One may state an intention to report all tests conducted or one may conduct a specific correction procedure; either strategy is acceptable.
-->
<p>For pedagogical reasons, we will use both Null Hypothesis
Significance Testing and, where relevant, posterior parameter estimation
and Bayes Factors.</p>
</div>
<div id="data-exclusion" class="section level3">
<h3>22. Data exclusion</h3>
<!-- 
How will you determine what data or samples, if any, to exclude from your analyses? How will outliers be handled? Will you use any awareness check?
Example: No checks will be performed to determine eligibility for inclusion besides verification that each subject answered each of the three tastiness indices. Outliers will be included in the analysis. 
More information: Any rule for excluding a particular set of data is acceptable. One may describe rules for excluding a participant or for identifying outlier data.
-->
<p>Only complete data files will be analysed. It is possible
participants may complete the experiment more than once; data files are
timestamped so only the first complete dataset for each participant will
be analysed. Participants will be excluded if their accuracy on the
easiest RDK is less than chance.</p>
</div>
<div id="missing-data" class="section level3">
<h3>23. Missing data</h3>
<!-- 
How will you deal with incomplete or missing data?
Example: If a subject does not complete any of the three indices of tastiness, that subject will not be included in the analysis.
More information: Any relevant explanation is acceptable. As a final reminder, remember that the final analysis must follow the specified plan, and deviations must be either strongly justified or included as a separate, exploratory analysis. 
-->
<p>Participants will be excluded if they do not complete all trials.</p>
</div>
<div id="exploratory-analysis" class="section level3">
<h3>24. Exploratory analysis</h3>
<!-- 
If you plan to explore your data set to look for unexpected differences or relationships, you may describe those tests here. An exploratory test is any test where a prediction is not made up front, or there are multiple possible tests that you are going to use. A statistically significant finding in an exploratory test is a great way to form a new confirmatory hypothesis, which could be registered at a later time. 
Example: We expect that certain demographic traits may be related to taste preferences. Therefore, we will look for relationships between demographic variables (age, gender, income, and marital status) and the primary outcome measures of taste preferences.

<!-- Adjust MathJax settings so that all math formulae are shown using
TeX fonts only; see
https://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/web/configuration.html. This will make
the presentation more consistent at the cost of the webpage sometimes
taking slightly longer to load. Note that this only works because the
footer is added to webpages before the MathJax javascript. -->
